# Analyzing the Relationship Between Weather Events and Traffic Accidents in NYC (2012-2023)

## Project Motivation
Traffic accidents are a major concern in large metropolitan areas like New York City. Weather conditions, such as heavy rain, snow, or extreme temperatures, can potentially influence the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. In this project my aim is to analyze how different weather conditions impact traffic accidents in NYC over the past decade (2012-2023).

## Data Sources
In this project I will utilize publicly available datasets:
- **NYC Vehicle Crashes (2012-2023)**: A dataset containing records of vehicle crashes in NYC, sourced from Kaggle.
- **NYC Weather Data**: Historical weather data for NYC. The current dataset available includes only 2019, so a more extensive dataset covering 2012-2023 will be identified and used.

## Data Collection & Enrichment Plan
Since the weather dataset currently covers only 2019, additional weather data will be collected to cover the full timeframe (2012-2023). Possible sources include:
- NYC Open Data 
- Additional publicly open datasets

Once both datasets are available, they will be merged based on date and location to analyze correlations between weather events and accident occurrences.

## Expected Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - I will handle missing values and inconsistencies on the data.
   - I will standardize date formats to merge datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - It will be identified trends in accident frequency over time.
   - It will be analyized weather conditions on high-accident days.
3. **Statistical & Hypothesis Testing**
   - I will check if certain weather conditions significantly impact accident rates.
4. **Machine Learning Application**
   - In this project I will use predictive modeling to estimate accident likelihood based on weather conditions.
5. **Visualization & Insights**
   - Lastly, I will do visualizations to highlight patterns and correlations.

## Timeline
- **March 14**: Submitting project proposal (this document)
- **April 18**: Collect data and conduct exploratory data analysis
- **May 23**: Apply machine learning models
- **May 30**: Final submission and presentation

## Expected Outcome
In this project I will focus on to providing insights into how different weather conditions impact road safety in NYC. The findings could contribute to better urban planning, traffic regulations, and driver awareness during adverse weather conditions.
